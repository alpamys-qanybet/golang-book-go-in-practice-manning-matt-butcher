- The Go philosophy of simplicity plus extensibility that created a useful language and enables an ecosystem to surround it
- Features of Go that take advantage of modern hardware, such as goroutines that enable concurrent execution
- The toolchain accompanying the Go language, including testing, package management, formatting, and documentation

Notes:
- Go has neither a ternary operator (usually ?:) nor type generics.
- Multiple return values. Go functions and methods can return multiple values.
- The named return variables are available to have values assigned to them.
When return is called with no values, the current values for the return names are returned.
- To run func in parallel rather than in order, you use the go keyword.
This causes main to continue executing immediately. Both func and main execute concurrently.
func count() {
    // do stuff
}

func main() {
    go count()
    // do stuff
}

- channels can be one-directional or bidirectional.
- a variable is passed from one goroutine to another through a channel.
This operation works even when goroutines are running in parallel on different processor cores.
- c <- b // writing to channel
  a := <-c // reading from channel

- Using channels and goroutines together provides functionality similar to lightweight threads or internal micro-services that communicate over a type-defined API.
These can be chained or pieced together by using various techniques.

- Many modern programming languages have package managers, but how many have package management built right in? Go does
The obvious reason is programmer productivity.
The second reason is faster compile time.
Package handling was designed with a compiler in mind.
It’s one of the reasons the compiler is so fast.

- go get.
The go get command can accept a path, such as golang.org/x/net/html, to get an individual package or ./... can be used,
which will walk through the codebase and get any referenced external packages.

- Numerous editors have commands, either built in or through add-on packages, to handle formatting for you. These include Vim, Sublime Text, Eclipse, and many others.
For example, the Sublime Text package GoSublime updates the formatting of a file when it’s saved.

- ($GOPATH/bin) If you’d like to install binaries to an alternative location, the GOBIN environment variable can be set to that path. This is an optional environment variable.

Notes:
- Designed as a systems language, Go doesn’t provide native support for building windowed applications.
- The argument and flag handling in the Go standard library is based on Plan 9,
which has a different style from the systems based on GNU/Linux and Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD),
such as Mac OS X and FreeBSD, that are in wide use today.
